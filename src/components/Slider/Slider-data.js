        desc: "Good decisions, consistently made, build wealth.

I am not following a get rich scheme. I’m not mortgaged up to the eyeballs in rental property. I’m just following the bright idea that MMM so eloquently explained in his blog posts. As I gather more data year after year, I see that this simple strategy works."
